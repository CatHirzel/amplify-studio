:::DESCRIPTION:::
Organizations choose to build APIs with GraphQL because it helps them develop applications faster, by giving front-end developers the ability to query multiple databases, microservices, and APIs with a single GraphQL endpoint.

Amplify also offers a REST API category that can be used for creating signed requests against Amazon API Gateway.
